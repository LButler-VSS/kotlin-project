# Overview

Learning Kotlin with Kotlin!

This software is a console app that will walk the user through some of the basics
of Kotlin by taking their input through the terminal on what to learn next.

When it comes to learning a new language, I appreciate having access to the code to
see and understand how the syntax and logic works for it. Having an app that will
both tell the user how to write in Kotlin, then having examples right in its own code
is the kind of learning material that I know I would appreciate having.
